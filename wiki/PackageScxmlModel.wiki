== State ==

_This class represents a state_

*Attributes*
  * protected String id;
  * protected State parent;
  * protected List< State > children;
  * protected List< Transition > transitions;

==== public State(String id) ====

  * Constructor, creates a new state and sets it's id
  * @param id - ID of new state

==== public State(String id, State parent) ====

  * Constructor, creates a new state and sets it's id and parent
  * @param id - ID of new state
  * @param parent - Parent of new state

==== public String getId() ====

  * Gets ID of this state
  * @return  ID

==== public State getParent() ====

  * Gets parent state of this state
  * @return  parent state

==== public List< State > getChildren() ====

  * Gets all children of this state
  * @return  List of children

==== public State addChild(State state) ====

  * Adds a child state to this state 
  * @param   State to add as a child

==== public void addTransition(Transition transition) ====

  * *Internal* Adds a transition to the list of transitions. 
  * Checks if transition actually contains this state and if a transition 
  * from this to the other state already exists.
  * You won't need to call this method as it is automatically called by      
  * Transition's constructor 
  * @param transition
  * @throws IllegalArgumentException
  * @throws NoSuchElementException
